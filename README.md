## Health Monitor Arduino Project


Description

The Health Monitor Arduino Project is a simple health monitoring system that utilizes an Arduino board, a MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter sensor, and a SIM800L GSM module. The system measures heart rate, blood oxygen level, and body temperature, displaying the information on an LCD screen. It also sends warning messages to a predefined phone number when certain health conditions are detected.

This project is intended for educational and non-commercial purposes. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute the code according to the terms mentioned in the license.

## Features

- Measures heart rate, blood oxygen level, and body temperature.
- Displays health data on an LCD screen.
- Sends warning SMS messages to a predefined phone number for certain health conditions.
- Easily customizable and extendable.

## Components

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter sensor
- SIM800L GSM module
- Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) with I2C interface
- Various electronic components (resistors, wires, etc.)

## Installation

1. Connect the hardware components according to the wiring diagram provided.
2. Upload the provided Arduino sketch (`health_monitor.ino`) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Modify the code as needed (e.g., set your phone number for SMS notifications).
4. Power up the system and observe the health data on the LCD screen.
5. The system will automatically send warning SMS messages when certain health conditions are detected.
